- 🔶 *maybe harmful -- deprecation, or possible breaking change*
- 🍏 *harmlesss -- addition, fix, or enhancement*

<br/>

## v0.3

### v0.3.0

- 🟥 replaced `expose` function with similar new `endpoint` function
  ```ts
  // OLD -- this is outdated
  new HttpServer(expose(({headers}) => fns))

  // NEW -- do it like this now
  new HttpServer(({headers}) => endpoint(fns))
  ```
  - this new design is cleaner, and non-http apis like postMessage don't need to pretend and pass fake headers like before
  - we also removed the concept of an `Api` type and the `api` helper function
  - if you were using `api`, you are now expected to roll-your-own, like this:
    ```ts
    // OLD
    const myApi = api(({headers}) => ({...myFunctions}))
    new HttpServer(expose(myApi))

    // NEW
    import {ServerMetas} from "renraku"
    const myApi = ({headers}: ServerMetas) => ({...myFunctions})
    new HttpServer(meta => endpoint(myApi(meta)))
    ```
- 🟥 rename `maxPayloadBytes` to `maxRequestBytes`
- 🍏 add `timeout` for HttpServer and also WebSocketServer, defaults to 10 seconds.
